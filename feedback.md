Good job!

For the Problem1, Problem2 and Problem3, it would be better to write a function to simulate.

For problem3.b and 3.c, please try to automatically find the fair probability and probability increment.

Great job! Please add some comments for the key steps.

For problem1.c, the mean needs to be calculated using the time with bankroll less or equal to zero.

No answer for Problem2

For problem3.b and 3.c, please try to automatically find the fair probability(from 46% to 50%) and probability increment.

For problem4, the **boot_ci** function needs to take the dataset and the estimating function as input.

Good job! 

To simulate the game, it would be better to use the binomial distribution rather than the uniform distribution.
